# hello-world

Well, this will be considered my official start on GitHub.

I consider myself an autodidact and a student-for-life; thus I find conventional schooling restricting, suffocating, and not to mention expensive (seeing as I can learn all the IT skills I want online or on my own for near nothing).

I highly value liberty of the individual and seek to create a better world in the realm of cybersec.
